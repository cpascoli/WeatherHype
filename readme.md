[openweathermap.org](http://openweathermap.org) weather API.

WeatherHype is implemented is Swift 3 and therefore requires Xcode 8.0 to run.

Just open the `WeatherHype.xcworkspace`in Xcode and hit 

* `CMD+U`  to build & run the tests

Future Improvemens
=

There are many things I'd like to improve given more time, including:

* Ability to search for weather in different cities 
* Ability to manage a list of cities recently accessed.
* High resolution and high quality images for different weather states (I used low res images avaiable on openweathermap as placeholders.)
* High quality app icons (I used a simple png, upscaled to all correct sizes using [makeappicon.com](https://makeappicon.com))
* Localisation: translated strings and localised formats.
* Allow the user to switch between metric and imperial units.
* Automatically refresh the weather data when the app becomes active.
* Improvements to the visual design.
